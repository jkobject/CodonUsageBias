 ##### TODO ######

 - store my matrix as a savez
 - set the right number of cluster. 

 ######## IDEAS #######

- see if there is a similarity in the cluster position of each of their genes. 
- compare the similarities between the species for each types of related genes between the species
- find a relationship between
