 ##### TODO ######

 
 -9 function to process each simple function on all the data

 -10 function to have the same genes for each species : 
 we are getting the comparer (the species against which, all the homologies have been  found)
instead of just similarity to one specie, do a graph search on them (nodes are species, links are homologies ->find the biggest fully connected graph) --> problem, it is on the data previous to what I receive... (the algo of YUN)

 -11 store my matrix as a savez
 -12 set the right number of cluster. 
 -13 add a verification that the function are not called in a wrong order
 -21 change the pipeline according to the biopython package
 -30 create a CDC for the pipeline

 -31

 ######## IDEAS #######

-14 see if there is a similarity in the cluster position of each of their genes, compare it and find relationships
-15 compare the similarities between the species for each types of related genes between the species
-16 find a relationship between 
-17 plot entropy location values similarity between genes of one particular individual
-18 look for philogenetic similarity using ncbi taxonomy information/website or the information for Tobias



 ###### INFO ########

- the species are ordered according to philogenetic/taxonomic similarities
send an email to tobias for the name of the comparer species.
ask for the philogenetic list amongs the 461 species
the species present here are all the same ones. 

- find how to replace Nans as they convey info and couldnot be replaced by 0 or 1 (maybe 0.5 ?)
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html

- look at the equations on the thesis. 



-Pipeline of the matlab code
so you have one species and you look for homologies to a subset of 5818 genes of this species. 
th
main = homologyvalue()
then you gethomoinformation() to get the information about the homology to 461 species
then you look at preinstalled genotype of 461 species and get this particular gene 


- read the paper
- cancerous cells should have a particular kind of codon usage bias (more than regular cells)

-  Entropy location : you compute the entropy value for each possible configuration, it makes a distribution to wich you compare the measured entropy value. with a integration.

- there is a whole genome part as well 
KL method : for the comparison of the whole genome per species (only exons !) we sum up all the distributions and normalize them ( by the length of the gene) and we compute the KL divergence to the distribution made by the measured distribution made by the plotting of all the exons
Expected entropy: (see notebook)

- focus first on the classification 
- be really carefull about what you are goin to present on your thesis. 

###### QUESTIONS ########

- how are you finding your homologies I feel as though they are not the same for every species. How can I compare them in this way ? 
-should I normalize the data using the lenghth to compare them ? no
- how do I read your csv ?
- where can I get the philo tree that you have ?

### To say ####


problem on what I am going to write and do as a master thesis
	python package with full pipeline (versatile)
	how much can I say about yun's work ( she was stressed)



 ###### require #########

temperature
replication speed
frequency of use of the gene
nocive species

Phase (1) – Business understanding
Understanding the business objectives and requirements, and converting them into a data mining problem

Phase (2) – Data understanding
Understand the data to be mined, consider data quality issues

Phase (3) – Data preparation 
Data cleaning, attribute and record selection, data transformation, etc.; dependent on the data mining algorithm(s) to be used in (4)

Phase (4) – Modelling / data mining phase
Choose one or more data mining algorithms to be applied to the data, adjust its(their) parameters, build a model of the data
Includes an initial objective, data-driven validation

Phase (5) – Model evaluation
Interpret and validate the models from a business perspective 

Phase (6) – Deployment of the model
Deploy the data mining results in the form of a plan, monitoring and maintaining the plan deployment
