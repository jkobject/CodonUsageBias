A description of the files found in this folder:

mkRedtable.sh  This file takes a synotable, as Yun produces it and prodices a file (tmp) which contains usable cub data for AAs with two codons only. Usable means that for each AA it shows the proportion of the codon that is less frequent

mkDistrib.R  it takes statistics for each AA and length for all AAs with 2 codons and fits them to a model. This model is defined in fitModel.xxx (which is a maple script). It then fits to the model an returns the fitted parameters. The important ones are a and b and the residual. The output of this is nonlinfit??.txt (where the ?? indicates the lengths).


interactiveMkDistrib.R   similar to mkDistrib, but interactive. Makes it possible to fit and view 1 particular amino acid/species

analysisFunctions.Rscript   ... contains all the functions necessary to analyse the cub


figures.Rscript  .... produces all the figures for the paper (and a few more)

temperatureanalysis/protistanalysis/bacterianalysis   ... scripts to interactively analyse and explore the fungi/protist/bacteria genomes

parameterFitsFungi, parameterFitsBacteria,etc..   contains the fits of the distributions of codons to the simple energy model described n the paper. Each file considers a paricular sublength only but for all species and all AAs with 2 codons.
