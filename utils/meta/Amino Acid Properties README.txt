Data sources for physical properties of amino acids:

>>>General sources:

Molecular_Weight - the molecular weight of the amino acid without crystal water

NH2_pKA,COOH_pKA,sidechain_pKA - the dissociation constant for acid/ base groups

pI - the isoelectric point

no_atoms - the number of atoms making up the amino acid

>>>Zamyatnin, A.A. (1972) Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol., 24: 107-123

volume - solution volume in AA^3

>>>Monera et al., J. Protein Sci. 1: 319-329 (1995).

Hydrophobicity_index - a relative measure of the hydrophobicity 

>>>This study (with data from Henikoff and Henikoff (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 10915–10919. 

Conservation_Index: calulated from the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix as abs(sum(AA(non-self))/AA(self))

>>>Barton et al. (2010) PLoS One 5: e11935

rel_C_cost, rel_N_cost, rel_S_cost; cost in terms of individual elements
rel_glucose; relative synthesis cost in terms of glucose equivalents (A_glucose in paper)

>>>Craig and Weber (1998) Molecular Biology and Evolution 15: 774–776.
