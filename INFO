We are currently developping what will be a full python package for the codon usage bias problem
 





Method of work : 
---------------

As a solo project and my method of work consist in writing some information about the code being develloped in 
the TODO.txt file. 

I will have a research report going on on this link : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FjMTWjNO9CuLlf8HVdw1smfPYXc69yjsxggIIQv9o9c/edit?usp=sharing

Moreover the code is for now developped on pipeline and tested on notebooks, it will be further implemented with different
classes and genes still being a master class with which the user will interact directly. 

I will get inspiration from the scikit-learn and CaImAn packages. 


Future work : should involve a refactoring of the entire project to create a package for general genomic inference in python
